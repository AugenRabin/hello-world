My first GitHub repository, using [the official GitHub quickstart tutorial for beginners](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

# About me:
I am a recent college graduate who majored in Software Engineering. Currently trying to learn the C programming language for practice and to build experience. I like archiving things and watching cat videos.
